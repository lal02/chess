ideas:

refactor drag listeners and displaying pieces to its own class (no need to have it implemented each time again)
refactor some button functions?

remove rounded corners from background image

add promotion GUI ingame


Fix multiplayer (use only chessboard.fxml and only one controller for it)
improved multiplayer with dedicated server that handles multiple clients at once

rework and improve move (and moveValidation)

gamemode with limited time

test if random puzzle takes random from the whole range of puzzles
edit existing puzzles
multi move puzzles

replay games -> game class = list of moves with winner (and final board state for display?)
-> saved in database -> converter or web scrapper for pro games into database?
-> save played base in database with user given title?

database with chess openings that you can learn

generate gif from game

chessbot

play custom game where you can edit the settings (time etc)

import feature for other custom themes?
create your own themes by replacing a color in the settings and set a new square color for it?
