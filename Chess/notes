TODO implement:
pawn promotion
checkmate detection
stalemate detection
3 time repetition



checkmate:
    after every move if the opponent is checkmated -> einzige option da sonst auf move input gewartet wird und dann erst checkmate detected wird
    => where?
                * move constructor after calling isValid and adding the move to the playedmoves arraylist
                * movevalidation at isValid ending after simulating the current move and after that check if opponent is checkmated
                * board
                * main after parsing the input


TODO:
tests for all pieces

FIXME
when calculating checks the board still gets updated for some reason... FIXED

TODO long-term:
gui
System that allows to build a position with drag and drop and save the board
Puzzle gamemode with database
