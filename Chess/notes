ideas:

refactor drag listeners and displaying pieces to its own class (no need to have it implemented each time again)

refactor some button functions?

add promotion GUI ingame

import feature for other custom themes?

Fix multiplayer (use only chessboard.fxml and only one controller for it)

gamemode with limited time

improved multiplayer with dedicated server that handles multiple clients at once

chessbot

edit existing puzzles

multi move puzzles

replay games -> game class = list of moves with winner (and final board state for display?) -> saved in database -> converter or web scrapper for pro games into database?

rework and improve move (and moveValidation)

play custom game where you can edit the settings (time etc)

remove rounded corners from background image

generate gif from game

test if random puzzle takes random from the whole range of puzzles

create your own themes by replacing a color in the settings and set a new square color for it?

database with chess openings that you can learn
