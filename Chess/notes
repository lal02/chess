TODO implement:
pawn promotion
checkmate detection
stalemate detection
3 time repetition

TODO:
tests for all pieces
tests for check detection

FIXME
when calculating checks the board gets updated anyway or check didnt get calculated correctly(checktest)
Check prevention seems to be bugged, when preventing a check with a backwards bishop move like in testRookCheck the move is considered illegal
-> when searching for a straight check, I dont check if I have diagonal piece I can block it with?

TODO Longterm:
gui
System that allows to build a position with drag and drop and save the board
Puzzle gamemode with databaseS

// is my en passant implemented correctly? by the rules of chess
