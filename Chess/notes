ideas:
improved gui usability (back button etc)
gamemode with limited time
improved multiplayer with dedicated server that handles multiple clients at once
chessbot
edit existing puzzles
replay games
logging for each object etc created and all the things that happen during the application start (new file for every time we start the application)
